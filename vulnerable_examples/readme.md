# how to compile the vulnerable_examples

All the rules are described by makefiles, so GNU Make is required (AFAIK).
It is recommended to have make in the path, so that MS developer consoles can run make too.
Open common/c_rules.makefile and set up CL32, CL64, GCC32 and GCC64 proprerly:

- GCC32 and 64 assumes at least one of the two versions is on the path; compiling using one of the two temporarily adjusts the path to contain the desired compiler.
- CL32 and 64 are based on a configuration in which "make" is invoked on a machine and cl.exe is run in another machine; check common/remote.sh
- if your setup for cl.exe is very different... I did my best, there are two commented CL32/64 definitions, that expects:
  - two opened Windows consoles
  - in the first, run: vcvars32.bat from build tools (or visual studio, too, i think)
  - in the second, run: vcvars64.bat
  - then run make on both consoles; if you don't pass the target binary to "make", one console will spit out errors but it should work eventally.
