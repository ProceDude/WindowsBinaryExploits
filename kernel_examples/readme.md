# how to run

## any hevd-related exploit

- download and compile HEVD (e.g. from github)
- check if common/ioctls.hpp contains the correct ioctls (probably yes)
- if no, run "common/fetchIoControls.bat" passing the location of HEVD's source
- load the HEVD driver:
  - use an external program to load it despite being non-signed
  - enable test mode as admin: bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING on && shutdown -r -t 0

## tokenStealing
this one is more realistic, so after compiling:

- launch loadIntel.exe in an Admin Command Prompt and keep it opened
- note the ntoskrnl base from loadIntel.exe output
- launch expl.exe in another CommandPrompt with ntoskrnl base

## all exploits

- run the included compile.bat with no args
- deal with the specific additional requirement as outputed by compile.bat
- run again with the specified args
